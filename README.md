- 👋 Hi, I'm Alexander Belov. My hobby is the development of Alepiz. It is a system for automation and monitoring.
- 👀 I'm interested in making more people aware of my Alepiz project. I'm sure it will be useful to many.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Internet marketing. I need to somehow tell people about my project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people who want to implement automation and monitoring in their companies and with developers who will create new modules for Alepiz.
- 📫 If you would like to contact me, please email me at asbel@alepiz.com
